# we are not using sa because we are using eso to read secrets and eso is using the iam role with readSecretValue policy attached to it, that is further attached to the worker node to read the secrets. As we use SA for IRSA and for that case we need to have EKS cluster or OIDC provider setup. But since we are using kubeadm self-managed cluster, so we are not using SA. 
# In this case, we create iam role with readSecretValue policy attached to it and attach it to the worker node to read the secrets. This is the best practice to read secrets in self-managed cluster running on EC2 instances.
